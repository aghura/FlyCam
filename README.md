# FlyCam
Allows Arduino to control BLDC motors via the ESC and calibrate them.

The User Input file allows the user to input the specific rate at which they would like the motor to be running.
The BLDC10% is a much simpler file which focuses on getting the motors running at 10% power while providing an option to abort the system.
